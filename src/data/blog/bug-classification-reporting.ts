    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Understanding Bug Classification</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Bug classification is the process of categorizing defects based on various attributes to help prioritize fixes and allocate resources effectively. A well-defined classification system improves communication between QA and development teams and ensures that critical issues are addressed promptly.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Bug Severity</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Severity describes the impact of a bug on the system's functionality:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Critical</strong>: System crash, data loss, security vulnerability, or complete feature failure</li>
      <li><strong>Major</strong>: Significant feature malfunction with no workaround</li>
      <li><strong>Moderate</strong>: Feature malfunction with a workaround available</li>
      <li><strong>Minor</strong>: Small issue that doesn't affect functionality (e.g., UI alignment)</li>
      <li><strong>Cosmetic</strong>: Visual issues that don't impact functionality (e.g., typos, color inconsistencies)</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Bug Priority</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Priority indicates how urgently a bug needs to be fixed:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>P1 (Urgent)</strong>: Must be fixed immediately, blocking further testing or development</li>
      <li><strong>P2 (High)</strong>: Should be fixed in the current sprint or release</li>
      <li><strong>P3 (Medium)</strong>: Should be fixed if time permits in the current release</li>
      <li><strong>P4 (Low)</strong>: Can be deferred to a future release</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong>Note</strong>: Severity and priority are related but distinct. A high-severity bug might have low priority if it affects a rarely used feature, while a low-severity bug might have high priority if it affects a key customer.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Other Classification Dimensions</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Additional ways to classify bugs include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Type</strong>: Functional, UI/UX, Performance, Security, Compatibility, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Environment</strong>: Development, Testing, Staging, Production</li>
      <li><strong>Component/Module</strong>: Which part of the system is affected</li>
      <li><strong>Root Cause</strong>: Code defect, requirement misunderstanding, configuration issue, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Status</strong>: New, Assigned, In Progress, Fixed, Verified, Closed, Reopened</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Writing Effective Bug Reports</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">A well-written bug report provides all the information needed to understand, reproduce, and fix the issue. It serves as a communication tool between testers, developers, and other stakeholders.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Essential Components of a Bug Report</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">A comprehensive bug report should include:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Summary/Title</strong>: Clear, concise description of the issue</li>
      <li><strong>Description</strong>: Detailed explanation of the problem</li>
      <li><strong>Steps to Reproduce</strong>: Numbered steps to consistently recreate the issue</li>
      <li><strong>Expected Result</strong>: What should happen when following the steps</li>
      <li><strong>Actual Result</strong>: What actually happens</li>
      <li><strong>Environment</strong>: OS, browser, device, app version, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Severity and Priority</strong>: Classification as discussed above</li>
      <li><strong>Screenshots/Videos</strong>: Visual evidence of the issue</li>
      <li><strong>Logs/Error Messages</strong>: Technical details if available</li>
      <li><strong>Additional Context</strong>: Any other relevant information</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Bug Report Example</h3>
    <div class="bg-gray-100 dark:bg-gray-800 p-4 rounded-lg mb-6">
      <p class="font-semibold">Bug ID: BUG-123</p>
      <p><strong>Summary</strong>: Checkout process fails when using saved credit card</p>
      <p><strong>Description</strong>: When a user attempts to complete a purchase using a previously saved credit card, the checkout process fails at the payment confirmation step.</p>
      <p><strong>Steps to Reproduce</strong>:</p>
      <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 space-y-1">
        <li>Log in with account that has a saved credit card</li>
        <li>Add any item to cart</li>
        <li>Proceed to checkout</li>
        <li>Select the saved credit card as payment method</li>
        <li>Click "Complete Purchase"</li>
      </ol>
      <p><strong>Expected Result</strong>: Order is processed and confirmation page is displayed</p>
      <p><strong>Actual Result</strong>: Error message "Payment processing failed" appears and order is not completed</p>
      <p><strong>Environment</strong>: Chrome 98.0, Windows 10, App version 2.4.1</p>
      <p><strong>Severity</strong>: Critical</p>
      <p><strong>Priority</strong>: P1 (Urgent)</p>

      <p><strong>Error Logs</strong>: Console shows "TypeError: Cannot read property 'token' of undefined"</p>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Best Practices for Bug Reporting</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Follow these guidelines to create effective bug reports:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Be specific and objective</strong>: Focus on facts, not opinions</li>
      <li><strong>One bug per report</strong>: Don't combine multiple issues</li>
      <li><strong>Use clear, descriptive titles</strong>: Make the issue immediately understandable</li>
      <li><strong>Provide minimal reproduction steps</strong>: Simplify to the essential steps</li>
      <li><strong>Include relevant context</strong>: Add all information needed to understand the issue</li>
      <li><strong>Avoid assumptions</strong>: Report what you observe, not what you think caused it</li>
      <li><strong>Be constructive</strong>: Focus on improving the product, not assigning blame</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Bug Tracking and Management</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Effective bug management involves more than just reporting issues:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Use a dedicated bug tracking system</strong>: Jira, Azure DevOps, GitHub Issues, etc.</li>
      <li><strong>Establish a triage process</strong>: Regularly review and prioritize new bugs</li>
      <li><strong>Track bug metrics</strong>: Monitor trends in bug discovery, resolution, and reopening</li>
      <li><strong>Define a bug lifecycle</strong>: Establish clear status transitions and ownership</li>
      <li><strong>Close the feedback loop</strong>: Ensure reporters are notified when bugs are fixed</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Remember that the ultimate goal of bug reporting is to improve product quality. A collaborative approach between QA, development, and product teams leads to more efficient resolution and better outcomes.</p>
