    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Test Levels: The Testing Pyramid</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Test levels represent different granularities at which testing is performed. The testing pyramid illustrates the ideal distribution of tests, with more tests at lower levels and fewer at higher levels.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Unit Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Unit testing focuses on testing individual components or functions in isolation:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Tests individual functions, methods, or classes</li>
      <li>Usually written and executed by developers</li>
      <li>Runs quickly and provides immediate feedback</li>
      <li>Uses frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, or Jest</li>
      <li>Often employs mocking to isolate the unit under test</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong>When to use</strong>: During development, as part of continuous integration</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Integration Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Integration testing verifies that different components work together correctly:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Tests interactions between integrated components</li>
      <li>Identifies interface defects</li>
      <li>Can be approached as "Big Bang," "Top-Down," or "Bottom-Up"</li>
      <li>May involve testing API endpoints, database interactions, etc.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong>When to use</strong>: After unit testing, when components need to be tested together</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">System Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">System testing evaluates the complete, integrated system:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Tests the entire application as a whole</li>
      <li>Verifies that the system meets specified requirements</li>
      <li>Includes both functional and non-functional testing</li>
      <li>Typically performed in an environment similar to production</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong>When to use</strong>: After integration testing, before acceptance testing</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Acceptance Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Acceptance testing determines if the system satisfies acceptance criteria:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Validates that the system meets business requirements</li>
      <li>Often performed by end-users or clients</li>
      <li>Includes User Acceptance Testing (UAT)</li>
      <li>May include alpha and beta testing</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed"><strong>When to use</strong>: After system testing, before release to production</p>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Test Types</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Test types categorize tests based on their objectives and can be applied at different test levels.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Functional Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Functional testing verifies that the system functions as expected:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Smoke Testing</strong>: Basic tests to verify critical functionality</li>
      <li><strong>Sanity Testing</strong>: Focused testing after bug fixes</li>
      <li><strong>Regression Testing</strong>: Ensures new changes don't break existing functionality</li>
      <li><strong>Exploratory Testing</strong>: Simultaneous learning, test design, and execution</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Non-Functional Testing</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Non-functional testing evaluates aspects other than specific behaviors:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Performance Testing</strong>: Evaluates speed, responsiveness, and stability</li>
      <li><strong>Load Testing</strong>: Tests behavior under expected load</li>
      <li><strong>Stress Testing</strong>: Tests behavior under extreme conditions</li>
      <li><strong>Security Testing</strong>: Identifies vulnerabilities and security risks</li>
      <li><strong>Usability Testing</strong>: Evaluates user-friendliness</li>
      <li><strong>Compatibility Testing</strong>: Tests across different environments</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Other Test Types</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Additional specialized test types include:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Black Box Testing</strong>: Testing without knowledge of internal code</li>
      <li><strong>White Box Testing</strong>: Testing with knowledge of internal code</li>
      <li><strong>Gray Box Testing</strong>: Combination of black and white box approaches</li>
      <li><strong>A/B Testing</strong>: Comparing two versions to determine which performs better</li>
      <li><strong>Mutation Testing</strong>: Evaluating test suite quality by introducing defects</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Choosing the Right Tests</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">When deciding which tests to implement, consider:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Project requirements and constraints</li>
      <li>Risk assessment (test critical features more thoroughly)</li>
      <li>Available resources and time</li>
      <li>Team expertise</li>
      <li>Return on investment for each test type</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">A balanced testing strategy typically includes a mix of test levels and types, with automation applied strategically to maximize efficiency.</p>
