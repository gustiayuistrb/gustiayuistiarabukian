    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Introduction to Quality Assurance</h2>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Quality Assurance (QA) is a systematic process that ensures a product or service meets specified requirements and customer expectations. In software development, QA focuses on improving the software development process to prevent defects rather than just finding them.</p>
    
    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">Quality Assurance vs. Quality Control</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">While often used interchangeably, QA and QC are distinct concepts:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong> is process-oriented and focuses on preventing defects by improving development processes.</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Control</strong> is product-oriented and focuses on identifying defects in the finished product.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">Think of QA as building a proper road with guardrails to prevent accidents (proactive), while QC is like having police officers catch speeding drivers (reactive).</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">The Importance of Quality Assurance</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">Implementing QA in software development offers numerous benefits:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Reduced development costs by catching issues early</li>
      <li>Improved product quality and reliability</li>
      <li>Enhanced customer satisfaction and trust</li>
      <li>Streamlined development processes</li>
      <li>Better team collaboration and communication</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-6 mt-8">Key Components of Quality Assurance</h2>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">A comprehensive QA strategy includes several key components:</p>
    <ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li><strong>Quality Planning</strong>: Defining quality standards, processes, and methodologies</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Control</strong>: Testing and verification activities</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Improvement</strong>: Continuous process improvement</li>
      <li><strong>Quality Assurance</strong>: Process audits and evaluations</li>
    </ol>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">QA in Agile Development</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">In Agile environments, QA is integrated throughout the development process:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>QA professionals participate in sprint planning and daily standups</li>
      <li>Testing occurs continuously rather than at the end of development</li>
      <li>Automation plays a crucial role in maintaining quality with rapid iterations</li>
      <li>Collaboration between developers and QA is emphasized</li>
    </ul>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold mb-4 mt-8">QA Best Practices</h3>
    <p class="mb-4 leading-relaxed">To implement effective QA in your organization:</p>
    <ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
      <li>Start QA activities early in the development lifecycle</li>
      <li>Establish clear quality metrics and standards</li>
      <li>Implement automation where appropriate</li>
      <li>Foster a quality-focused culture across the organization</li>
      <li>Continuously review and improve QA processes</li>
    </ul>
